Student Advising Application

###2.4 Operating Environment###

The operating environment for this project is any web browser that utilizes HTML 5 and CSS 3. As such, most personal computers, tablets, and smartphones will be able to access the platform. Hardware that will be able to access the site will include, but not be limited to, any device running iOS 6.0 or above, Mac OS X or above, Windows 7 or above, Android 4 or above, and using a web browser that properly displays and uses HTML 5 and CSS 3: the latest versions of Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and Opera should all work satisfactorily with this product.

###2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints###
The main design and implementation constraint for this project is that the developers are all learning new technologies, including C# and ASP.NET; some of us have never had experience with HTML, CSS, or databases either. We have chosen to go with a web app in order to ensure compatibility across hardware and operating systems, but we do this with the understanding that a web connection is not always available. However, we have not designed the software to work in an offline environment. 

###2.6 User Documentation###
It is our hope that the web application is self-explanatory and will not need supplementary materials of any kind. However, if this were an actual software product, it is likely that some sort of customer service/technical support contact would be established and maintained by the developers, in case a user/customer had any kind of question.
